The Odin Project Landing Page

This repository hosts a project webpage built to display an example landing page for a business. The repo has an index.html file used as the home page and a styles.css stylesheet used to style the webpage.

If you open index.html, you will see the example landing page that was created by me based on info that came from two example images of the webpage provided by The Odin Project. The webpage is not an exact replica, because not all the details were provided to make it exact.

The links and buttons on the page are non-functional and will only keep returning to the index.html.

I found this project to be fun and a bit challenging trying to get it all to look as close as possible to the exmaple images. I know my code, especially on the CSS side, is a bit of a mess and probably in no way the most practical way of doing this.
